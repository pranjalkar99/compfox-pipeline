Such documents are not to be attached as exhibits to answers to petitions for reconsideration, and any such violation in the future may lead to the imposition of sanctions. (Cal.

Code Regs., tit. 8, § 10848.)2Reconsideration is granted, and the WCJs July 26, 2013 Findings Of Fact is rescinded as our Decision After Reconsideration. The case is returned to the trial level for development of the record, </span><span style="font-family:Arial; letter-spacing:0.05pt">further</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> proceedings on the issue of jurisdiction, and for a new decision by the WCJ.BACKGROUNDIt is admitted that applicant incurred cumulative </span><span style="font-family:Arial; letter-spacing:0.05pt">injury</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> to multiple body </span><span style="font-family:Arial; letter-spacing:0.1pt">parts</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> while employed by the Bills as a professional football player during the period June 9, 2001 through November 20, 2002, and it is admitted that he played in two games in California during that time. However, defendant disputes WCAB jurisdiction over applicants workers compensation claim.According to the May 30, 2013 Minutes of Hearing, the issues of the statute of limitations, whether or not the applicant had sufficient contacts with the State of California to confer jurisdiction, and whether New York is the more appropriate venue for the claim were tried by the WCJ </span></p><p style="margin-top:0.95pt; margin-bottom:0pt; line-height:13.2pt"><br style="page-break-before:always; clear:both" /><span style="font-family:Arial">on that date.

Applicant also testified that he was in California for four days to play in two games while employed by the Bills from June 9, 2001 to November 20, 2002.3In her </span><span style="font-family:Arial; letter-spacing:0.05pt">Report,</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> the WCJ first notes a concern about the verification of applicants petition,4 andthen explains the reasons she found that California does not have jurisdiction over applicants claim, asfollows: 2 Appeals Board Rules of Practice and Procedure, Rule 10848 provides as follows: When a petition for reconsideration, removal or disqualification has been timely filed, supplemental petitions or pleadings or responses other than the answer shall be considered only when specifically requested or approved by the Appeals Board. Supplemental petitions or pleadings or responses other than the answer, except as provided by this rule, shall neither be accepted nor deemed filed for any </span><span style="font-family:Arial; letter-spacing:0.05pt">purpose</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> and shall not be acknowledged or returned to the filing party. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, § 10848.)3 Applicant also acknowledged in his testimony that he filed a workers compensation claim in New York for a May 16, 2002 </span><span style="font-family:Arial; letter-spacing:0.05pt">injury</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> to the left knee that he incurred while employed by the Bills and that he received a $28,800 award in New York for that </span><span style="font-family:Arial; letter-spacing:0.05pt">injury</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> claim.4 The verified declaration of applicants attorney Christopher Perry that is attached to applicants petition appears to substantially comply with the verification requirement. (Lab. Code, § 5902.) Regardless, lack of verification is not a jurisdictional requirement that mandates dismissal. (Wings West Airlines v. Workers Comp. Appeals Bd. (Nebelon) (1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 1047 [51 Cal.Comp.Cases 609].) , [justify]As to the argument that my decision was based on application of[/justify][justify][McKinley], the employment contract while offered into evidence was not[/justify][justify]the basis for the decision. The opinion does not refer to any discussion of a[/justify][justify]choice of forum clause within that contract although the contract does[/justify][justify]contain one - New York. As indicated within the opinion the contacts with[/justify][justify]the State of California were found to be insufficient to confer jurisdiction.[/justify][justify]Here Applicant did not enter into his employment contract in California[/justi- fy][justify]and other than the four (4) days in California noted above and the fact that[/justify][justify]Cal- ifornia taxes were taken out of his paychecks, Applicant had no other[/justify][justify]contacts with the state. The decision was based on the fact that Applicants [/justify][justify]contacts with the state were minimal and therefore California jurisdiction [/justify][justify]should not extend to this injury. (Bracketed material added or substituted,[/justify][justify]emphasis added.)[/justify]DISCUSSIONWe rescind the WCJs decision because it appears she </span></p><p style="margin-top:0.95pt; margin-bottom:0pt; line-height:13.2pt"><br style="page-break-before:always; clear:both" /><span style="font-family:Arial">applied a personal jurisdiction analysis to conclude that the WCAB has no jurisdiction over applicants claim. However, there is no question that the WCAB has personal jurisdiction over applicant and defendants with regard to the claim of industrial injury.The WCAB has personal jurisdiction over applicant because he acceded to WCAB jurisdiction over his person when he filed his claim with </span></p><p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; line-height:13.15pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">the WCAB. The WCAB also has personal jurisdiction over the defendants because the Bills generally appeared to contest applicants claim. The Bills have sufficient contact with California to be subject to WCAB personal jurisdiction because the team purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting business in California by taking deliberate action to play games in the state and by creating a continuing obligation to the residents of the state by scheduling future games in California. Finding personal jurisdiction over the </span><span style="font-family:Arial; letter-spacing:0.05pt">parties</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> in this case is </span><span style="font-family:Arial; letter-spacing:0.05pt">supported</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> by the decision of the Appeals Board in McKinley, where the issue of personal jurisdiction in that case was addressed as follows:[justify] Due process requires that a defendant have </span><span style="font-family:Arial; letter-spacing:0.05pt">certain</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> minimum contacts with[/justify][justify]a state so that the maintenance of an action in the state does not offend [/justify][justify]traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. (International Shoe[/justify][justify]Co. v. Washington (1945) 326 U.S. 310 [66 S. Ct. 154, 90 L. Ed. 95].) In [/justify][justify]this case, defendant purposefully availed itself of the privilege of[/justify][justify]conducting business in California by taking deliberate action to play games [/justify][justify]in California and has created continuing obligations to residents of the state[/justify], [justify]by scheduling future games in the state. California has personal[/justify][justify]jurisdiction over the Cardinals. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; letter-spacing:0.05pt">(Martin</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> v.

Moreover, applicant has a cognizable claim that is subject to WCAB jurisdiction under the current statutes </span></p><p style="margin-top:0.05pt; margin-bottom:0pt; line-height:13.15pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">and law. The WCAB has repeatedly exercised subject matter jurisdiction over claims of cumulative industrial </span><span style="font-family:Arial; letter-spacing:0.05pt">injury</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> when a </span><span style="font-family:Arial; letter-spacing:0.05pt">portion</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> of the injurious exposure causing the </span><span style="font-family:Arial; letter-spacing:0.05pt">injury</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> occurs within this state, as applicant alleges in this case.
