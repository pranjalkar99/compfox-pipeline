It is beyond cavil to state that Mr. Boyds conduct which led to the imposition of the order, and which he subsequently continued to engage in, would not meet the standards of conduct which apply to attorneys licensed to, practice in the State of California.We do not conclude, at this time, that Mr. Boyds conduct is in violation of the cease and desist order. However, if Mr. Boyd engages in such conduct in the future which fails </span></p><p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; line-height:13.15pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">to meet the standards of conduct which apply to attorneys and non-attorney hearing representatives alike, we will take steps to enforce the cease and desist order. This is a final warning that </span><span style="font-family:Arial; letter-spacing:0.05pt">further</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> misconduct at the Appeals Board or disrespectful language in his pleadings and documents will result in the instigation of proceedings pursuant to Labor Code section 4907, to remove his privilege to appear before the Workers Compensation Appeals Board as a non-attorney hearing representative. Mr. Boyd is hereby advised and reminded to be respectful to everyone involved in these proceedings, including counsel for defendant, defendants claims adjusters, the WCJ, and the staff of the Division of Workers Compensation. Mr. Boyd should familiarize himself with the standards of professional conduct applicable to attorneys appearing in WCAB proceedings, as his future conduct will be measured against these standards.We also note defendants </span><span style="font-family:Arial; letter-spacing:0.05pt">assertion</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> that Mr. Boyd may be in violation of other applicable regulatory requirements, in so far as he has held himself out as engaging in business as a para-legal. Mr. Boyds letter addressed to the Workers Compensation Appeals Board, dated August 7, 2012, is on letterhead that indicates Mr. Boyd holds himself out as a Para-Legal.Anyone who is engaged in the business of Paralegal is subject to the requirements of Business and Professions Code section 6450 et seq, and is required to work under the supervision of an attorney licensed to practice in California. A paralegal must establish he or she has received training, evidenced by possession of a certificate of completion of paralegal training, and at minimum a written declaration from a supervising attorney stating that the person is qualified to perform paralegal tasks.
