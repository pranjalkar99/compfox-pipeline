Dr. Liegler finds no apportionment in his </span><span style="font-family:Arial; letter-spacing:0.05pt">report.</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> Dr. Wood found no preexisting apportionment under the previous definition of apportionment that has not been repealed. However, under causation apportionment of Labor Code Section 4663, he finds ap- portionment based on Petitioners x-rays showing degenerative disk disease.DISCUSSIONThe </span><span style="font-family:Arial; letter-spacing:0.05pt">parties</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> stipulated that the rating after apportionment would be 90%. Also by stipulation. if no apportionment, Petitioner would be totally and permanently disabled.Petitioner has two arguments. Petitioner argues that she is unable to compete in the open labor market, and based on Labor Code Section 4662, is considered totally and permanently disabled without apportionment. Specifically, the language: In all other cases, permanent total disability shall be determined in accordance with the fact. In addition, Petitioner argues Dr. Wood did not provide apportionment in his February 14, 2011 </span><span style="font-family:Arial; letter-spacing:0.05pt">report</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> when he indicated on page 30 that Petitioner was not going to be able to </span><span style="font-family:Arial; letter-spacing:0.05pt">return</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> to the open labor market specifically because of the multiplicity of her findings which combined to render her permanently totally disabled. MERRELL LEE CALVILLOADJ2287904Document ID: -1901013376306249728 , Petitioner does not indicate authority for the position that under Labor Code Section 4662, when an applicant cannot </span><span style="font-family:Arial; letter-spacing:0.05pt">return</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> to the open labor market, a finding of 100% total disability shall be found without regard to apportionment. It can be argued that an injured worker can be found to be totally disabled even after consideration of apportionment, but not in this case. Dr. Wood specifically provides apportionment and the </span><span style="font-family:Arial; letter-spacing:0.05pt">parties</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> stipulate that with apportionment, applicants permanent disability would be reduced to 90%. The cases cited in the Petition find applicant 100% disabled even with apportionment considered. They do not disregard apportionment.No case is cited which reaches the conclusion that any employee unable to compete in the open labor market prevents a finding of apportionment which contributed to applicants permanent disability. There is no provision in the Labor Code that eliminates apportionment if the applicant is unable to compete in the open labor market. If so. any time an applicant is 100%, apportionment would be excluded.

The patient has just had natural progression of these conditions over time and should be apportioned similarly.In fact, the discussion regarding apportionment got very heated in his deposition dated September 16, 2004, pages 35 through 38. On page 35 line 18: IM NOT GOING TO CONTINUE - WERE CONTINUING TO CHASE OUR TAILS WITH THIS. YOURE CONTINUING TO BADGER ME ON THE SAME POINT. I DONT AGREE WITH THE LAW, BUT I AM GOING TO STAY WITH THAT, OKAY.
